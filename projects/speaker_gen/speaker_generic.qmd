[Speaker knowledge modulates the effects of generic language on essentialist beliefs](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5fh0s9cb?utm_source=chatgpt.com). *Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, 47*.

## **Background**

Generic statements—those about categories rather than individuals (e.g., “Birds fly,” “Girls wear pink”)—can subtly shape beliefs, leading listeners to view categories as having fixed, intrinsic properties. The effect of these statements depends on pragmatic cues, which are signals in communication—like the speaker’s perceived expertise—that help listeners interpret meaning beyond the literal words. **In this study, I investigated whether speaker knowledge influences how children and adults interpret generic (versus specific) statements about a novel social category called Zarpies.**

## **Participants**

-   **Children:** 233 children (ages 5–10; 54% girls) recruited online using [PANDA](https://www.discoveriesinaction.org/accounts/home/).

-   **Adults:** 217 adults (ages 18–83; 49% female, 1% non-binary) recruited online using [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/).

## **Procedure**

Participants watched short narrated videos introducing a novel social category (“Zarpies”) with a unique property or behavior. Each statement varied in **language type** (generic vs. specific) and **speaker knowledge** (knowledgeable vs. unknowledgeable). Participants responded immediately after each statement, minimizing memory demands. Trials assessed three aspects of essentialist thinking:

1.  **Category-Based Explanations** – whether behaviors were attributed to category membership or individual choice.

2.  **Flexibility of Category Boundaries** – whether a member could display behaviors outside the category norm.

3.  **Within-Category Homogeneity** - how many members share a trait.

## **Analysis**

Analyses were conducted in R version 4.4.0. All code for cleaning, modeling, and visualization is available in the project repository. Deidentified data is available [here](https://github.com/jesslazen/speaker-generics).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#load in packages
library(tidyverse) 
library(readr)
library(Rmisc) 
library(lme4)
library(magrittr)
library(emmeans)
library(interactions)
library(car) 
library(cowplot) 
library(gridExtra) 
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include=FALSE}
# load data
data <- read_csv("data/speakergen_combined_clean.csv", 
                 col_types = cols(know = col_factor(),
                                  lang = col_factor()))
```

### Data Cleaning + Processing Overview

-   Excluded participants who completed less than 50% of survey (3 participants, 0.7%).

-   Re-coded responses to within-category homogeneity items using a median-split so all responses were binary:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # question 1
    median_q_homo1 <- median(data$response[data$item == "q_homo1"], na.rm = TRUE)
    model_data <- data %>%
      mutate(response = if_else(
        item == "q_homo1",
        as.integer(response >= median_q_homo1),
        response))

    # question 2
    median_q_homo2 <- median(data$response[data$item == "q_homo2"], na.rm = TRUE)
    model_data <- model_data %>%
      mutate(response = if_else(
        item == "q_homo2",
        as.integer(response >= median_q_homo2),
        response))

    ```

### Modeling

The logistic mixed-effects models used to examine the effects of **speaker knowledge** and **language** on essentialist responses were specified as follows.

#### Adult Model

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\big(P(Y_{ij}=1)\big) =\ &\\
&\beta_0\ + \\
&\beta_1 \text{Knowledge}_i\ + \\
&\beta_2 \text{Language}_i\ + \\
&\beta_3 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{Language}_i)\ + \\
&u_j + v_i
\end{aligned}$$ Where:\
- $Y_{ij}$ = binary response of participant ($i$) on item ($j$)\
- $u_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\text{item}})$ = random intercept for item\
- $v_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\text{ID}})$ = random intercept for participant

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_adult <- glmer(response ~ knowledge * language + (1|item) + (1|ID),
                          data = subset(model_data, age_group == "adult"), 
                          family = binomial, 
                          glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", 
                                       optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5)))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Child Model (with centered age)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\big(P(Y_{ij}=1)\big) =\ & \\
&\beta_0\ + \\
&\beta_1 \text{Knowledge}_i + \beta_2 \text{Language}_i\ + \\
&\beta_3 \text{Age}_i\ + \\
&\beta_4 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{Language}_i)\ + \\
&\beta_5 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{Age}_i)\ + \\
&\beta_6 (\text{Language}_i \times \text{Age}_i)\ + \\
&\beta_7 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{Language}_i \times \text{Age}_i)\ + \\
&u_j + v_i
\end{aligned}$$

Where $\text{Age}_i$ is a centered continuous predictor.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_child <- glmer(response ~ knowledge * language * center_age + (1|item) + (1|ID),
                          data = subset(model_data, age_group == "child"), 
                          family = binomial, 
                          glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", 
                                       optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5)))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Combined Model (Adults + Children)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\big(P(Y_{ij}=1)\big) =\ & \\
&\beta_0\ + \\
&\beta_1 \text{Knowledge}_i + \beta_2 \text{Language}_i\ + \\
&\beta_3 \text{AgeGroup}_i\ + \\
&\beta_4 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{Language}_i)\ + \\
&\beta_5 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{AgeGroup}_i)\ + \\
&\beta_6 (\text{Language}_i \times \text{AgeGroup}_i)\ + \\
&\beta_7 (\text{Knowledge}_i \times \text{Language}_i \times \text{AgeGroup}_i)\ + \\
&u_j + v_i
\end{aligned}$$

Where $\text{AgeGroup}_i$ indicates child vs. adult.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_both <- glmer(response ~ knowledge * language * age_group + (1|item) + (1|ID),
                          data = model_data, 
                          family = binomial, 
                          glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", 
                                       optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5)))
```

## **Results**

In the absence of significant age effects (no main effect or interactions with centered age or age group, ps \> .05), I report results from the combined model.

#### Combined Model (Adults + Children)

| Effect                           | Wald χ² | p-value            |
|----------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| Language                         | 37.59   | \<0.000 **\*\*\*** |
| Knowledge                        | 8.65    | \<0.01 **\*\***    |
| Age Group (Adult vs. Child)      | 0.96    | n.s                |
| Language × Knowledge             | 8.94    | \<0.01 **\*\***    |
| Language × Age Group             | 0.15    | n.s                |
| Knowledge × Age Group            | 0.89    | n.s                |
| Language × Knowledge × Age Group | 0.01    | n.s                |

There was a significant interaction between language and speaker knowledge (Wald $\chi^2$(1) = 8.94, p \< 0.01), indicating that the effect of generic language depended on the speaker’s knowledge. Age group did not moderate this effect. When the speaker was knowledgeable, participants were 3.05 times more likely to endorse essentialist beliefs in the generic condition ($\beta$ = 1.10, p \< 0.0001).

![Two-way interaction between language, and speaker knowledge (Wald $\chi^2$(1) = 8.94, p \< 0.05). Points represent individual mean responses and shaded regions represent 95% confidence intervals for child participants. Adult mean responses are displayed as larger points with error bars representing 95% confidence intervals.](assets/fig2.png)

Visual inspection of this figure suggested that younger children showed little differentiation between knowledgeable and unknowledgeable speakers, whereas older children appeared increasingly sensitive to speaker knowledge when interpreting generic statements. To probe this possibility, I conducted post hoc analyses examining the regions of significance for age.

## **Post-Hoc Analysis**

Further analysis using the Johnson-Neyman technique identified that the effect of speaker knowledge became statistically significant in the generic condition around age 7 and not earlier, suggesting that older children were more likely to differentiate between knowledgeable and unknowledgeable speakers when interpreting generic statements. Given that the three-way interaction with participant age was not reliable, however, these possible age-related changes should be interpreted with caution.

![Although these effects did not vary significantly by age, Johnson-Neyman analysis identified that the effect of speaker knowledge became statistically significant (p \< 0.05) in the generic condition beginning at age 7.12 (dashed line).](assets/jn_plot.png)

## **Discussion**

These findings suggest that generic language influences how people think about social categories. When a knowledgeable speaker uses generic statements, listeners are more likely to adopt the idea that the category is coherent and meaningful. In contrast, statements from an unknowledgeable speaker have less impact.

Children around age 7 and older were especially sensitive to speaker knowledge, indicating they are beginning to consider a speaker’s expertise when interpreting general statements. Younger children were influenced by generic language, but their ability to track speaker knowledge may depend on factors like memory and attention.

Future research could test this directly by manipulating memory demands or using subtler cues of speaker knowledge, like prior accuracy or confidence. Studying categories that are less culturally familiar, such as novel animals, could help show how speaker knowledge and language interact to shape essentialist beliefs.
